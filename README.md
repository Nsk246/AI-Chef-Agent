# AI-Chef--Agent
o help users solve the daily challenge of cooking with limited ingredients, I built an interactive AI agent that generates meal plans based on what is currently in their pantry. I engineered the system using LangChain Agents and RAG pipelines, allowing the AI to perform multi-step reasoning rather than just retrieving static text.
